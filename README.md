Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, holding 85% of global market share. That makes Android the natural starting point for new app developers. This series of courses teaches the basics needed to develop, design, manage, and distribute your own native Android application using the Kotlin programming language and the Android SDK. Part 3 focuses on how you can allow users to explore the various screens in your application.

You'll also learn how to use the Android framework to send messages that allow you to interact with other apps. As well as, how to use a Material Design Component to provide a seamless navigation experience between the various screens in your own app.

## Learning objectives
- Managining lifecycle events
- Managing views at runtime
- Handling navigation
- Working with a navigation menu

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in GitHub to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
