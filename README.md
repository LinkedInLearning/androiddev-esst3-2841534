Do you want to build an application for Android? The Android Development Essential Training series teaches the basics needed to develop, design, manage, and distribute your own native Android application using the Kotlin programming language and the Android SDK. In part 3, instructor Annyce Davis teaches you how to manage lifecycle events, views at runtime, navigation, and navigation menus. Annyce shows you how to inspect and handle lifecycle events on Android, offers a refresher on Kotlin lambdas, and introduces you to ViewModels and LiveData—as well as how you can use both to add and update data. She goes into how to use Intents to communicate with other app components and navigate between activities. Annyce also covers how to display a button on a toolbar and add a navigation bar. Bottom navigation bars make it easy for users to explore and switch between top-level views in a single tap; Annyce explains how to add this to your app, complete with menu items.

## Learning objectives
- Managining lifecycle events
- Managing views at runtime
- Handling navigation
- Working with a navigation menu

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
